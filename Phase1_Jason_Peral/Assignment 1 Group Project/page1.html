            Origins
        </h2>
        <p>
            Modifying cars dates back to the 1950s and has been getting more and more modern each decade it has been
            around. The car scene popped up around <br>
            the 1950s to have another form of entertainment aside from horse racing and for military troopers to blow of
            some steam before getting deployed <br>
            to various wars and military campaigns. With every decade of the car scene cars became more quicker and
            sleeker, this was done with the help of <br>
            advancing technology and engineering.

        <h2>
            Classifications based on car
        </h2>
        <p>
            There different categories that you get put into based on the car you drive. <br>
            These categories are mainly based on where the car was manufactured which <br>
            in turn is based on the cars brand.

        <h2>How to get in the car scene</h2>
        <p>
            Go to your local car meets. Car meets are where you can see which style of car you like and ask owners
            different questions like "what have you got done to it?".<br>

        </p>

        <p>
            Join a car club! Car clubs are a good way to connect with a group of people that either have the same style
            of car or maybe the exact same company. I personally am in club lexus toronto.<br>

        </p>

        <p>
            Get into your new ride. Getting into the car scene can be you just working on your car and learning from
            your mistakes or successes. What works for you might just work for you.
