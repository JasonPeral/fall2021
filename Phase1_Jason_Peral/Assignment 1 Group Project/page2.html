        <h2>What is crypto mining?</h2>
        <p>
            The term crypto mining means gaining cryptocurrencies by solving cryptographic equations through the use of
            computers.<br>
            This process involves validating data blocks and adding transaction records to a public record (ledger)
            known as a blockchain.<br>
            In a more technical sense, cryptocurrency mining is a transactional process that involves the use of
            computers and cryptographic processes to solve complex <br>
            functions and record data to a blockchain. In fact, there are entire networks of devices that are involved
            in cryptomining and that keep shared records via those blockchains.

        <h2>Is crypto mining legal?</h2>
        <p>
            Legality depends on 2 factors but for the most part crypto mining is legal.
        <ol>
            <li>Geographical location</li>
            <li>If you mine through illegal means</li>
        </ol>
        Illegal means of crypto mining can be cyber hacking using programming or installing malware on unsuspecting
        users and jacking processing power to acquire <br>
        quicker mining speeds.

        <h2>What you need to get started mining(basics)</h2>
        <h3><u>Buy the right computer hardware</u></h3>
        <p>To start mining you need the right hardware. One of the most important part of a mining rig is the graphics
            card which is where the most of the processing power will come from. <br>
            The more processing power you have the more crypto you can get rewarded with.
        <ul>
            <li>Motherboard</li>
            <li>Cpu</li>
            <li>Power supply</li>
            <li>RAM</li>
            <li>Most importantly: Graphics Card</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3><u>Setup an adequate cooling system</u></h3>
        <p>
            Since mining hardware releases a lot of energy in the form of heat, it is important to adopt ways to cool
            the system down.<br>
            Electric cooling fans and air fans placed next to the hardware can help you solve this problem.<br>

        </p>
        <h3><u>Setup a crypto wallet</u></h3>
        <p>
            Cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase can be used to open an account where you will receive the rewards
            you earn from mining.<br>

        </p>
        <h3><u>Download a mining software and join a mining pool</u></h3>
        <p>
            There are different mining softwares available for mining different cryptocurrencies. Once you find a
            legitimate one, connect it to your hardware. <br>
            Always double, triple check that the software is legit and does not have any malware as that is a quick way
            to give someone else the rewards. As a beginner <br>
            I would highly recommend nicehash quick miner as it will place you in the best pool possible through their
            software and is very beginner friendly! <br> <br>

        </p>
        <h3><u>Your Ready to start mining!</u></h3>
        <p>
            Most important thing with crypto is triple checking that files are safe when installing software and to
            secure and your password to your crypto wallet as that is <br>
            where all your rewards will be sent to. Rememer crypto mining has only appeared within the last 5-7 years
            and there are always hackers trying to file holes within.
